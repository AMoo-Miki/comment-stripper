## What does this do?

Takes a string and returns a new sstring with comments removed. Works with line comments, block comments, the first comment only, or all comments, and optionally ignores protected comments.

Works with JavaScript, Sass, CSS, Less.js, or any comments with the following formats:

```js
// Line comments

/* block comments like this */

/*  
 Or comments like this
 */

/**  
 * Or comments 
 * like this
 */

/*!
 * Optionally ignores protected comments, like this one
 */
```

## Usage

By default all comments are stripped.

```js
const strip = require('{%= name %}');
const str = strip('const foo = "bar";// this is a comment\n /* me too *\/');
console.log(str);
// => 'const foo = "bar";\n'
```
