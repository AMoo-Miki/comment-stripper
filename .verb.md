## What does this do?

Takes a string and returns a new string with comments removed. Works with line comments and/or block comments. Optionally removes the first comment only or ignores protected comments.

Works with JavaScript, Sass, CSS, Less.js, or any comments with the following formats:

```js
// Line comments

/* block comments like this */

/*  
 Or comments like this
 */

/**  
 * Or comments 
 * like this
 */

/*!
 * Optionally ignores protected comments, like this one
 */
```

## Usage

By default all comments are stripped.

```js
const strip = require('{%= name %}');
const str = strip('const foo = "bar";// this is a comment\n /* me too *\/');
console.log(str);
// => 'const foo = "bar";\n'
```
